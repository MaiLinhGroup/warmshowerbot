Warmshower Bot
====
The idea of the bot is to encourage users to give their peers, friends, colleagues etc. praises anonymously. The praises are especially set out to be only positive because they should serve as a source of uplifting for the one addressed in the praise. In short, in moment of self-doubt and -hate, read the praises to feel showered by others warm words about how awesome you actually are, hence the name ðŸ˜Š!
